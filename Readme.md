Loom Demo repository
====================

This is the repository in which I push the demos I present along with my presentations about the Loom project.

You can learn more about the Loom project and download the early access builds here: http://jdk.java.net/loom/

You can find the slides of the talk we did with RÃ©mi Forax here: https://speakerdeck.com/josepaumard/loom-nous-protegera-t-il-du-braquage-temporel and see the presentation here: https://youtu.be/wx7t69DylsI

You can find the slides of my [Devoxx UK](https://www.devoxx.co.uk/) talk here: https://speakerdeck.com/josepaumard/loom-is-blooming

The version of Loom you need to run the examples is `jdk-19-loom+6-625`.

The `runConfigurations` directory contains the run configurations you can use to run the various examples. They have been created using IntelliJ IDEA and may not be working with other IDEs.
